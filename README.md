Module 12 Challenge

Instructions

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Part 2: Update the Database

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

Used VSCode instead of Jupyter Notebook for this homework, I enjoy it more. Did a lot of work with mongo and cleaning data frames. Used module 12 activities for refference and google and chatgpt to manage some of the larger cells.
